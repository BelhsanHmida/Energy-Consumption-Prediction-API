# Future Improvements

This folder contains suggestions and plans for improving the Energy Consumption Prediction API. Contributions are welcome!

## Suggested Improvements

### Model Optimization

- **Feature Engineering:** Investigate additional features that could improve model performance, such as weather data or economic indicators.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Conduct a thorough hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Experiment with ensemble methods to combine multiple models for better predictions.

### API Enhancements

- **More Edge Case Handling:** Improve the handling of edge cases, such as very long forecast windows. Investigate the impact of forecasting several days or weeks into the future and implement measures to ensure accuracy.
- **More Error Handling:** Enhance error handling to provide more informative messages for various failure scenarios.
- **Scalability:** Implement techniques to improve the scalability of the API, such as caching, load balancing, and database optimizations.
